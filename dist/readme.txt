How to Start:
-------------------------------
Enter ./system/ folder and launch mobius.exe, or run run_demo.bat both launches the game

Control instructions:
-----------------------------------
You move by applying a force to the lol-ball, in slow-mo the force you apply is greater than in normal time. Get to the particle spray/goal at the end of each level as fast as you can.

Game play:
-------------
The goal is to get as much points as possible.
 * You get points by completing a level.
 * You get points by doing combos (more on this soon)
 * You loose points all the time, at the same rate. Slow-mo doesn't affect this.
 * You don't loose points when you fall out
 * You point count isn't restored when you complete a level. You carry your score with you the whole time, but you can get away with those lousy scores by doing comos.

Combo's
-----------
At the moment there is only two simple combos. In slow-motion, jump a few times to trigger the combo

Known bugs:
----------------
If you go too fast, you may fall through the world, use slow-motion to counter this effect
